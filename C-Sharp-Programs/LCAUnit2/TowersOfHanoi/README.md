# Towers of Hanoi

## LCA Unit 2 Checkpoint 1

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three towers and 4 rings. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another tower, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one ring can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper ring from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a ring can only be moved if it is the uppermost ring on a stack.
3) No ring may be placed on top of a smaller ring.
